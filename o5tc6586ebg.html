The design and manufacturing APs harmonized the approach to  support three dimensional geometry with the adoption of ISO 10303-514{#18376},  Advanced boundary representation. Subsequently, editions of AP 203, AP  209{#95805}, AP 210{#29983}{#84361}, AP⁠&nbsp;214, AP 219, AP 224, AP 238 and AP 240{#37813}  became available that used the harmonized approach in those two areas. That  established a solid baseline for manufacturing even as research and development  of software interfaces supporting mechanical model to piece part fabrication  and inspection workflow automation continued{#35631}.</div><div>    </div><div>During the same  time period, ISO TC 10, ISO TC 213 and the ASME Y 14 standards committees continued  development{#77818},{#75641} of rigorous standards in support of model based  approaches to design and manufacturing. These updates removed many ambiguities  in the source documents, lending credence to the idea that information models  based on them should be updated. Documents supporting activities including  designer-software interaction (e.g., ISO 16792 and ASME Y14.41-2012), CAD to  CMM (e.g., ISO 1101) were becoming available lending clarification to data  exchange requirements between design and manufacturing (and back to design).  Horst et. al.{#90745} noted several requirements for design CAD PMI information  models.</div><div>    </div><div>As a result of  their implementation experience, the CAX-IF identified issues⁠&nbsp;with{Ranger, 2009, #72600},{#37027} AP 203 and  AP 214 coverage of relevant ASME and ISO standards. These issues were captured  in the instance{#51481} of bugzilla{#32662} devoted to ISO 10303 that is  managed by ISO TC 184/SC 4.</div><div>    </div><div>Over the past  decade, the data model and document publication architecture used for STEP were  revised to follow a modular approach (STEPmod). </div><div>    With the  available issues and the impetus of forthcoming documents from ISO TC 10, ISO  TC 213 and ASME Y 14, a project was established to update ISO 10303-47{#33831}  and relevant STEPmod modules. The project would result in publication of ISO  10303-242.</div><div>            </div>
