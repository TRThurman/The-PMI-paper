In this example, the actual geometric model details of instance #12 are not provided. Many other options are possible, e.g., #8 and #9 could be point_on_surface ENTITY types and the basis surface would then be provided, typically some form of face geometry. Other structural options are possible in the geometric model but the methodology of binding geometric elements to shape_aspects using item_identified_representation_usage (or the subtype geometric_item_specific_usage) should be followed to permit persistent identification and to support the unambiguous composition of the model feature itself. </div><div>The receiving STEP interface software would extract the associated geometric data from the file into an internal CAD model, would store the between_shape_aspect in an internal GPS model with persistent associativity to the internal CAD model, and would transform the between_shape_aspect with the CAD system internal symbol generator into a presentation of the “N←→M” in the receiving system attached to the tolerance frame. The presentation arrangement would be controlled by ISO 16792 and ASME Y14.41-2012 but would not be an exact match of the presentation arrangement in the source system.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="700306" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgements</h1><div>Figure two provided by B.

The areas of management data, presentation, representation, persistent identification, model feature, requirements on design model geometric properties, dimensional tolerances, datum system, geometric tolerances, continuous_shape_aspect_exchange_scenario, and deprecated entities in ISO 10303-47 were addressed.</div><div>Areas to consider for follow-on projects for subsequent editions of ISO 10303-242 include additional GPS domain specific standards related to:threads, surface texture specifications, edge condition specifications, welding specifications, machining feature groups, and statistical process control specifications. Extending ISO 10303-59{#49576} recommended validation for new shape_aspects and for revolute shapes could be considered. Planned_characteristics / Requirement_assignment to PMI data, i.e., could be extended to include dimensional_size, dimensional_location, geometric_tolerance as members of assigned_requirement.item. Model critical feature characteristics (e.g., non- GPS PMI) as commonly communicated via association to numbered “balloons” on drawings is yet another area to consider.</div><div></div><div>Additional areas to consider for follow-on projects for AP 242 include the additional GPS domain specific standards related to:threads, surface texture specifications, edge condition specifications, welding specifications, machining feature groups,SPC specifications.</div><div>Extending ISO 10303-59 recommended validation for new shape_aspects and for revolute shapes.</div><div>Extend Planned_characteristics / requirement_assignment to GD&amp;T data, i.e., include dimensional_size, dimensional_location, geometric_tolerance as members of assigned_requirement.item. This is the recognition gap again as no one thought to add those items to requirement_assigned_item “because they aren’t requirements they are notes, and anyway all data in the darned drawing is a requirement so what’s your beef?”</div><div>From Horst :</div><div>Model critical feature characteristics (e.g., non- GD&amp;T PMI) as commonly communicated via association to numbered “balloons” on drawings.
