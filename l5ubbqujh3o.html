Goals of the LOTAR project include: </div><div>	•	Developing a standards series for archiving and retrieval of product data of referred and needed methods, process modules, and data models.  </div><div>	•	Providing methods, process modules, and data models to enable long-term archiving and retrieval of CAD and PDM data along with electrical and composite design data.  </div><div>	•	Developing recommendations for practical introduction of long-term archiving of relevant data by industry.  </div><div>	•	Enabling the development of commercial off-the-shelf software based on user requirements generated in  cooperation with CAx-IF and jointly funded pilot projects.  A LOTAR-compliant archive must be sufficiently complete to enable re-manufacture and certification of aerospace composites. Since many aerospace vehicles are increasingly made of composite structural parts, AP209 composites has been added to the set of LOTAR-referenced standards. Such pressing industrial needs are driving the research and development work outlined in this section. </div><div>            </div>
