Thomas Thurman, 2/21/16, 5:59 PM] tolerances are used in the specification of a feature of the surface of a product. A geometric tolerance defines a tolerance zone, which is a region in space in which the product feature must lie. The shape of the zone depends upon the kind of tolerance and feature. When necessary, the location and orientation of the tolerance zone is specified with respect to a datum system. Improved support for tolerance zone requirements indicated in the updated ASME and ISO standards is included in the second edition of ISO 10303-47 but tolerance zone is not discussed further in this document. The ASME term feature control frame and the ISO term tolerance frame are represented in ISO 10303-47 by the geometric_tolerance ENTITY type, its subtypes and related entities. Extensive work has been done to update the geometric_tolerance ENTITY type to meet the updated ASME and ISO standards while ensuring that existing assets are minimally impacted. Domain specific subtypes of geometric_tolerance include:</div><div></div><div></div>
