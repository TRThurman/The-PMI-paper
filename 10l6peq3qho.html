The PMI project participants include industry  represented by the Long Term Archiving And Retrieval (LOTAR) consortium, that  is comprised of many of the aerospace companies worldwide{#69413}; the project  includes CAD suppliers represented by the CAX-IF{#63275}, which is a software  interface implementation forum supporting product data exchange standards. The  PMI project included requirements from model based design product data  definition practices, dimensional tolerances, and geometrical tolerances of  form, orientation, location and runout. Requirements for datums, datum systems  and tolerance frames were included. Existing capabilities of STEP were compared  to the requirements defined by the updated documents and extensions were  created as needed. The use of the EXPRESS{#2616} SELECT and SUBTYPE constructs  in extensions to existing constructs were proposed to provide upward  compatibility.</div><div>    </div><h1 data-label="390266" class="ltx_title_section"><a><b>Scope and  contribution</b></a><b><span></span></b></h1><div>    </div><div>This document  describes the development history and process, includes a description of the  management data common in the distributed enterprise, identifies EXPRESS ENTITY  types that are deprecated in the second edition of ISO 10303-47, describes the  structure of the new datum_system ENTITY type, describes some of the  improvements in dimensional tolerancing and in geometrical tolerancing, and  identifies future research opportunities.</div><div>            </div>
