<div>The ISO and ASME standards provide a rich set of tolerance modifiers that are supported with new types in ISO 10303-47. The use of extensible types supports future extensions to ISO 10303-47 as the ISO and ASME standards evolve. The extensible ENUMERATION type geometric_tolerance_modifier may be applied to dimensions or to geometric properties. In some cases, the ASME or ISO requirement is satisfied by the name of the entity type to which the tolerance is applied instead of by a specific ENUMERATION value.</div>
