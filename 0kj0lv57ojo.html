Figure bobo illustrates the key STEP product model  schemata that Dimension tolerance and Geometric tolerance models are dependent  upon. Classification structures from ISO 10303-519{#62366} and ISO  10303-522{#95216} were merged into ISO 10303-47 where necessary for&nbsp; model cohesion. The document information  models were integrated using STEPmod‚Å†{#81615} architecture into an  EXPRESS model suitable for implementation and incorporated into the ISO  10303-242 document. In most cases the upward compatibility constraint was met.  In cases where it was infeasible to achieve upward compatibility due to new  requirements of the source standards, existing structures were maintained in  the information model so that existing assets would not be subject to  obsolescence.</div><div></div><div>            </div>
