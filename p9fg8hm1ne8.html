<div>	•	Enabling the development of commercial off-the-shelf software based on user requirements generated in  cooperation with CAx-IF and jointly funded pilot projects.  A LOTAR-compliant archive must be sufficiently complete to enable re-manufacture and certification of aerospace composites. Since many aerospace vehicles are increasingly made of composite structural parts, AP209 composites has been added to the set of LOTAR-referenced standards. Such pressing industrial needs are driving the research and development work outlined in this section.</div>
