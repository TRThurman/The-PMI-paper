<div></div><div>Industrial users of ISO 10303 (STEP)  protocols nethe ability to exchange design product data that is in  conformance with recently updated ISO Geometric Product Specifications (GPS)  ISO 1101{#44304}, ISO 5459{#82589}, ISO14405-1{#64293}, ISO 14405-2{#24842};  with ASME Dimensioning and Tolerancing Standard ASME Y14.5-2009{#96622}, and  with recently updated Digital Product Data Definition Practices Standards ISO 16792{#95187}  and ASME Y14.41-2012{#33317}. Updates to those standards were made to support  continued migration from drawing-based Product and Manufacturing Information  (PMI) exchange to full model based exchange, sharing and management across  life-cycle viewpoints (i.e., design to fabrication to inspection). The  aerospace and automotive industries created a joint project to merge ISO  10303-203{#32050} and ISO 10303-214{#14111} into ISO 10303-242{#25194} rather  than pursue individual updates. Relevant STEP information models have been  updated and new information models created to support the ASME and ISO  standards, resulting in the publication of ISO 10303-242.</div>
