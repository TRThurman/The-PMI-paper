Industry needs to continue migration from drawing based PMI exchange  to full three dimensional model based exchange and sharing.</div><div>            -                                    </div><div><a name="Problem_statement"><b>Problem statement</b></a><b><span></span></b></div><div>    </div><div>Both the aerospace industry supported  ISO 10303-203:2011 (AP 203 ed2) and the automotive industry supported ISO  10303-214:2010 (AP 214 ed3) required updating to support recent updates in ISO  1101, ISO 5459, ISO 14405-1, ISO 14405-2, ISO 16792, ASME Y14.5-2009 and ASME  Y14.41-2012. Those updates created by ASME, ISO TC10 and ISO TC 213 contribute  to three dimensional model based PMI for presentation and for representation.  Upward compatibility is a constraint on any modifications to the STEP  information models where there are existing implementations. In this case,  there were significant assets in software implementations and digital data that  had to be considered. A consensus was achieved in ISO TC 184/SC 4 that AP 203  and AP 214 shall be merged into a new Application&nbsp; Protocol, AP 242{#40001}.</div><div>            </div>
