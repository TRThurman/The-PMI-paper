Those updates created by ASME, ISO TC10 and ISO TC 213 contribute  to three dimensional model based PMI for presentation and for representation.  Upward compatibility is a constraint on any modifications to the STEP  information models where there are existing implementations. In this case,  there were significant assets in software implementations and digital data that  had to be considered. A consensus was achieved in ISO TC 184/SC 4 that AP 203  and AP 214 shall be merged into a new Application&nbsp; Protocol, AP 242{#40001}.</div><div>            </div>
