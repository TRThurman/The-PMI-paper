<h3 data-label="610135" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Management Data</h3><div>Management data is used by design, manufacturing process planning, manufacturing execution, and by quality organizations, all as a common layer for authority and identification. The management data requirements of ASME Y14.41-2012 and ISO 16792 are supported by the existing STEP product data management (PDM) information model and by a new module ISO/TS 10303-1810 Product and manufacturing information view context. As an example, the tolerance principle to apply to a model is basic information needed by manufacturing process planning, fabrication and inspection. However, the tolerance principle specified by ASME is different than the tolerance principle specified by ISO. The tolerance principle is applied to a model by a formal specification of the dimensioning standard that shall be used to interpret the model GPS data. The integration of the existing PDM information model and ISO/TS 10303-1810 into ISO 10303-242 resulted in the ability to specify the dimensioning standard that applies.&nbsp; The ISO/TS 10303-1811 Product and manufacturing information with nominal 3D model module supports the ability to declare that the model geometry is nominal as defined in ISO 17450-1.</div><div>The&nbsp; ISO/TS 10303-1050 Dimension tolerance, ISO/TS 10303-1051 Geometric tolerance, and ISO/TS 10303-1816 Model based 3d geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing representation modules provide manufacturing technology independent GPS information for use by design, manufacturing process planning, manufacturing execution, and by inspection, all as a common layer for geometric functionality. Improvements in product feature identification capability to support quality failure reporting have been provided by updates to ISO/TS 10303-1032 Shape property assignment{#57427}. Improvements in geometric model element identification capability to support GPS requirements have been provided by updates to ISO 10303-41{#59269}.</div><div>The ISO/TS 10303-1812 Product and manufacturing annotation presentation module supports annotation of nominal 3D geometric models with text and graphics that can be used by design, manufacturing process planning, and inspection human processes.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="492431" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Presentation and representation</h3><div>The state of the practice that existed in the initial STEP mechanical design domain AP development was that during one activity a user interacts with a CAD system to build a geometric model based on ISO 10303-42{#23019}; during a separate activity a user interacts with a CAD system to annotate that geometric model with graphic information based on ISO 10303-46{#30634}; during a separate activity a user interacts with a CAD system to annotate that geometric model with semantic dimensioning and tolerancing information based on ISO 10303-47:1997. The separate activities lead to editions one of AP 203, AP 202{#36506}, and AP 224 respectively. The result is that there a recognition gap{#94591} between the annotation and the dimensioning data sets of models created based on those editions. The recognition gap persists in ISO 10303-242. There is a conceptualization gap between requirements and notes{#94591} in the ISO 10303 mechanical domain information models. The conceptualization gap persists in ISO 10303-242 increasing interoperability costs between e.g., system engineering and mechanical engineering communities.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
